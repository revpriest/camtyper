A program to type characters if you ain't got
no fingers by waving LED wants in front of
the webcam.

The webcam view is split into left and right
hand sides. There should be one LED shining
into each half.

Left hand controls mode, and right hand types
a character in that mode.

EG: Left hand down-left means 'vowels' and
then right hand top-right means 'e'

Program shows the modes on the left hand
and the current mode is reflected on the
right hand grid. Move the light into the
region to type the character.

Barely started right now, but can send chars
to stdout. Not sure why it doesn't work properly
when piping into Bash.
